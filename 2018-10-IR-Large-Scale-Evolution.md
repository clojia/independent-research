Q. Le, and A. Kurakin. Large-scale evolution of image classifiers.
In International Conference on Machine Learning,
2017.

## Motivation
To minimize human participation in neural network design, this paper employed evolutionary algorithms to discover networks architectures automatically. The paper stress that "no human participation is required once evolution starts and that the output is a fully-trainied model".

## Method

### Evolutionary Algorithm & Mutation
