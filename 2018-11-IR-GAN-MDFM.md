## Index
Kim, Jungtaek, et al. "OPEN SET RECOGNITION BY REGULARISING CLASSIFIER WITH FAKE DATA GENERATED BY GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS." (2018).

## Motivation
The paper present a new method to generate fake data in unknown classes in generative adversarial networks(GANs) framework, who were served effective augmented data for open set classifier.
## Method
